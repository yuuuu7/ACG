# Singapore poly Applied Cryptography project

Within this project, there are multiple aspects of cryptography being put into consideration

1. Protection in transit, use and at rest
2. Uses modules like pycryptodome to conduct encryption
3. Involves the usage of Self-signed certs to simulate the trust between 2 stakeholders, preventing eavedroppers
4. Includes color coded CLI logging to note down every important step/process when running the scripts
5. Server and client to simulate communication in a real-world scenario
